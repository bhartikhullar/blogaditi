                Conceptual understanding doesn’t just happen at the whiteboard. But it can be achieved by incorporating fun math activities into your lessons, including

  			<p class="text-muted " ><h1>
                1. Explicit instruction
            </h1>
        <p>You can’t always jump straight into the fun. Explicit instruction still provides the best foundation for the activities to come. 

            Set up your lesson for the day at the whiteboard, along with materials to demonstrate the coming activities. Make sure to also focus on any new vocabulary and concepts. 
            
            Tip: don't stay here for too long. Once the lesson is introduced, move on to the next fun strategy for the day!</p>
            <br>
            <h1>
                2. Conceptual understanding
            </h1>
            <p>
                Helping your students understand the concept behind the lesson is crucial, but not always easy. Even your highest performing students may only be following a pattern to solve problems, without grasping the “why.”

                Visual aids and math manipulatives are some of your best tools to increase conceptual understanding. Math is not a two dimensional subject. Even the best drawing of a cone isn’t going to provide the same experience as holding one. Find ways to let your students examine math from all sides.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>
                3. Using concepts in Math vocabulary
            </h1>
            <p>There’s more than one way to say something. And the more ways you can describe a mathematical concept, the better. Subtraction can also be described as taking away or removing. Memorizing multiplication facts is useful, but seeing these numbers used to calculate area gives them new meaning. 

                Some math words are going to be unfamiliar. So to help students get comfortable with these concepts, demonstrate and label math ideas throughout your classroom. Understanding comes more easily when students are surrounded by new ideas. </p>
                <br>
                <h1>4. Cooperative learning strategies</h1>
                <p>When students work together, it benefits everyone. More advanced students can lead, helping them solidify their knowledge. And they may have just the right words to describe an idea to others who are struggling.

                    It is rare in real-life situations for big problems to be solved alone. Cooperative learning allows students to view a problem from various angles. This can lead to more flexible, out-of-the-box thinking. 
                    
                    After reviewing a word problem together as a class, ask small student groups to create their own problems. What is something they care about that they can solve with these skills? Involve them as much as possible in both the planning and solving. Encourage each student to think about what they bring to the group. There’s no better preparation for the future than learning to work as a team. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>5. Meaningful and frequent homework</h1>
                    <p>When it comes to homework, it pays to think outside of textbooks and worksheets. Repetition is important, but how can you keep it fun?

                        Create more meaningful homework by including games in your curriculum plans. Encourage board game play or encourage families to play quiz-style games at home to improve critical thinking, problem solving and basic math skills. </p>
